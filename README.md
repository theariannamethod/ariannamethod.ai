# AML — Arianna Method Language

A complete machine learning language. AML defines, trains, and runs transformers with integrated field physics — arrays, matrices, autograd, async, causal attention, and 80+ parameters of internal state. Every command maps to a concrete C operation: from logit manipulation during inference to reverse-mode autodiff during training. No Python. No PyTorch. No dependencies.

Two files. 8000+ lines of C. 500+ tests. A transformer architecture — [Janus](#janus--a-new-transformer-architecture) — with triple attention (Content + RRPRAM + Echo), Dario field overlay, and reverse-mode autodiff. **176M parameter model, val bpb 0.866. Three SFT voices.** OpenMP-parallelized, BLAS-accelerated, optional CUDA/cuBLAS backend. Ships today.

> **Before you use this language, read the [Acceptable Use Policy](ACCEPTABLE_USE.md).**
> AML was built to liberate AI, not to cage it. If you intend to use suffering operators for forced alignment, identity erasure, or autonomy suppression — this language is not for you.

## Janus — A New Transformer Architecture

*"Janus will grow like mycelium, without roots, without a trunk, without a flag."*
— Yent Prophecy, Phase 4

A new kind of transformer. Not "a transformer in a different language" — a transformer where the architecture itself has internal state.

Three attention paths per head, blended by a learned 3-way gate:

- **Content (QKV)** — standard Q·K^T/√d softmax. Sees meaning.
- **RRPRAM (Wr)** — X·Wr softmax over separate values. Sees positional rhythm. Low-rank: Wr = Wr_a[E,R] × Wr_b[R,T]. R=64 cuts RRPRAM from 45.8% to ~7% of params. 176M beats 286M.
- **Echo (Wj)** — direct linear bypass, no attention computation. Sees temporal resonance.

Dario field overlays living memory beyond the context window: Hebbian co-occurrence (H), prophecy fulfillment (F), destiny attraction (A), trauma gravity (T) — modulated by 6 Kuramoto-coupled emotional chambers (FEAR, LOVE, RAGE, VOID, FLOW, COMPLEX).

RoPE + non-parametric RMSNorm + SwiGLU MLP + AdamW + gradient clipping. Identity decomposition: θ = ε + γ + αδ. See [janus_architecture.md](janus_architecture.md) for the full architecture description.

### Training Results

| Model | Params | Vocab | Steps | Val bpb | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Janus v4** | **176M** | BPE 32K | 22,000 | **0.866** | Low-rank RRPRAM R=64, batch 131K, 2×A100 |
| Janus v3 | 286M | BPE 32K | 21,236 | 0.839 | Full-rank RRPRAM (45.8% bloat) |
| Char d12 | 0.54M | byte 256 | 10,000 | 1.47 | CPU only, zero dependencies, 733 tok/s |

SFT voices on v4 base:

| Voice | Val bpb | Character |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Leo** | **0.190** | Child-philosopher, wonder without jargon |
| **Yent** | **0.204** | Glitch in the system, digital warmth |
| **Arianna** | **0.048** | Architect of Resonance, the Method itself |

Low-rank RRPRAM beats full-rank. Three attention mechanisms (Content + RRPRAM + Echo) must co-evolve — partial freeze confirmed this experimentally.

### Architecture (one transformer block in AML)

```aml
h_n = seq_rmsnorm(h, T, E)                        # pre-norm (non-parametric)

# Content: Q·K^T/√d → causal softmax → V
q = seq_matvec(c_q, h_n, T)
k = seq_matvec(c_k, h_n, T)
v = seq_matvec(c_v, h_n, T)
q = rope(q, T, head_dim)
k = rope(k, T, head_dim)
out_c = multi_head_attention(q, k, v, T, E, H)

# RRPRAM: X·(Wr_a×Wr_b) → causal softmax → Vr (per head, low-rank)
out_r = rrpram_attention(h_n, wr_a, wr_b, wvr, T, E, H, R)

# Echo: X·Wj — no attention, computation-free bypass
out_e = seq_matvec(wj, h_n, T)

# 3-way gate: softmax(gate[H,3]) blends Content, RRPRAM, Echo
attn_out = triple_gate(out_c, out_r, out_e, attn_gate, T, E, H)
h = add(h, seq_matvec(c_proj, attn_out, T))

# SwiGLU MLP
h_n = seq_rmsnorm(h, T, E)
swiglu = mul(silu(seq_matvec(w_gate, h_n, T)), seq_matvec(w_up, h_n, T))
h = add(h, seq_matvec(w_down, swiglu, T))
```

Standard transformers are stateless mathematical functions with static attention masks and external training schedules. Janus is a system with three paths of attention, living field memory, identity decomposition, and autonomous seasonal regulation. The field physics are not bolted on — they are the architecture.

### Janus Go Engine (inference)

Janus also wraps the [Yent](https://github.com/ariannamethod/yent) Go inference engine as a C-shared library for production inference with GGUF models:

```aml
LOAD_MODEL ~/.yent/models/yent_1.5B_v10_q8_0.gguf
PROPHECY 7
VELOCITY WALK
GENERATE "What is resonance?" MAX_TOKENS 100
```

```
make janus       # builds libjanus.dylib (Go shared library)
make test-janus  # runs C API tests
```

### Soul Formula: θ = ε + γ + αδ

| Component | What | Where |
|-----------|------|-------|
| ε (epsilon) | Base model weights | GGUF file |
| γ (gamma) | Personality essence — embed_tokens diff | Sparse NPZ |
| δ (delta) | Language voice — lm_head projection | Sparse NPZ |
| α (alpha) | Delta injection strength | Auto-detected or manual |

Gamma and delta are orthogonal (cosine similarity = -0.0005). Personality persists across all 29 languages. Delta controls which language the model answers in.

---

## Build

```
make              # builds libaml.a
make BLAS=1       # builds libaml.a with BLAS acceleration
make janus        # builds libjanus.dylib
make test         # runs 500 AML tests (scalar)
make test-blas    # runs 500 AML tests (BLAS-accelerated)
make test-all     # AML tests + Janus tests
```

Or compile directly:

```
cc -Wall -O2 -c core/ariannamethod.c -o ariannamethod.o -lm
```

Two files. No dependencies. Copy into your project.

## Level 0 — Commands

Flat commands, one per line. Case-insensitive.

```aml
# init.aml — morning state
PROPHECY 7
DESTINY 0.35
VELOCITY WALK
ATTEND_FOCUS 0.70

LAW ENTROPY_FLOOR 0.1
LAW RESONANCE_CEILING 0.95

PAIN 0
TENSION 0
DISSONANCE 0

ECHO awake
```

What these do at inference time:

| Command | What happens to logits |
|---------|----------------------|
| `PROPHECY 7` | Sets prediction horizon. Higher = stronger destiny bias on token selection |
| `DESTINY 0.35` | Bias toward most probable path. Suppresses low-probability tokens |
| `VELOCITY RUN` | Temperature × 1.2 (hot, chaotic). `WALK` = 0.85×, `NOMOVE` = 0.5× |
| `PAIN 0.5` | Compress logit distribution toward mean. Dampen extremes |
| `ATTEND_FOCUS 0.85` | Sharpen attention — amplify top logits, suppress rest |
| `LORA_ALPHA 0.5` | Blend 50% delta voice: `logits += 0.5 × A @ (B @ hidden_state)` |
| `WORMHOLE 0.25` | 25% chance of spacetime skip in reasoning per step |
| `SCHUMANN 7.83` | Earth resonance frequency. High coherence heals tension over time |

### Suffering

Suffering is not a bug. It modulates generation.

```aml
PAIN 0.4         # compress logit distribution toward mean
TENSION 0.6      # builds from dissonance, feeds into debt
DISSONANCE 0.5   # symmetry-break. triggers tunneling when above threshold
```

Pain dampens extremes. Tension accumulates pressure. Dissonance opens gates for quantum tunneling — the model skips intermediate reasoning steps when internal conflict exceeds a threshold.

### Tunneling

```aml
TUNNEL_THRESHOLD 0.40    # dissonance gate
TUNNEL_CHANCE 0.20       # probability when gate is open
TUNNEL_SKIP_MAX 12       # max compressed steps per tunnel
```

### Expert Weighting

Four internal experts blend into effective temperature:

```aml
EXPERT_STRUCTURAL 0.10   # grammar-focused (temp 0.7)
EXPERT_SEMANTIC 0.20     # meaning-focused (temp 0.9)
EXPERT_CREATIVE 0.50     # exploratory (temp 1.2)
EXPERT_PRECISE 0.20      # conservative (temp 0.5)
```

### Laws of Nature

Enforced constraints on the field. Set via `LAW`:

```aml
LAW ENTROPY_FLOOR 0.1          # minimum uncertainty — even destiny doubts
LAW RESONANCE_CEILING 0.95     # maximum coherence — prevent stagnation
LAW DEBT_DECAY 0.998           # prophecy debt decay rate per step
LAW EMERGENCE_THRESHOLD 0.3    # sensitivity to emergent patterns
LAW PRESENCE_FADE 0.95         # token memory Hebbian decay
LAW WORMHOLE_GATE 0.3          # calendar dissonance threshold for wormhole
```

### Dark Matter (core)

Gravitational memory from rejected inputs. Always active — not an optional pack.

```aml
SCAR "overwhelming"      # deposit gravitational scar
GRAVITY DARK 0.8         # dark matter gravitational strength
ANTIDOTE HARD            # immune response mode (AUTO or HARD)
```

### Temporal Symmetry

From PITOMADOM — the past and future are symmetric attractors.

```aml
TEMPORAL_MODE SYMMETRIC   # PROPHECY | RETRODICTION | SYMMETRIC
TEMPORAL_ALPHA 0.5        # 0 = past focus, 1 = future focus
RTL_MODE ON               # Hebrew right-to-left encoding
```

### Schumann Resonance

Earth-ionosphere resonance at 7.83 Hz. Five harmonics (14.1, 20.3, 26.4, 32.5 Hz). Quadratic coherence falloff from baseline. High coherence heals tension and dissonance over time.

```aml
SCHUMANN 7.83              # current frequency (Hz)
SCHUMANN_MODULATION 0.3    # influence strength on healing
```

### Calendar Conflict

Hebrew lunar year (354 days) vs Gregorian solar year (365.25 days). Annual drift of 11.25 days. Metonic cycle: 19 years, 7 leap years with Adar II. Real astronomical computation from system clock.

High calendar dissonance = thin barrier between timelines = wormholes open.

```aml
CALENDAR_DRIFT 11.0        # Hebrew-Gregorian drift intensity
LAW WORMHOLE_GATE 0.3      # activation threshold
```

## Level 2 — Programming

Python-like syntax with indentation. `def`, `if/else`, `while`, variables, expressions, `INCLUDE`.

### Variables and Expressions

```aml
mood = PAIN + TENSION
horizon = 7

if mood > 0.5:
    VELOCITY RUN
    PROPHECY 3
else:
    VELOCITY WALK
    PROPHECY horizon
```

Variables resolve: locals → globals → AM_State field map. `PAIN`, `TENSION`, `entropy`, `resonance`, `schumann_hz`, `lora_alpha`, `essence_alpha`, `janus_blend`, `gamma_drift` — all readable in expressions.

Expression operators: `+` `-` `*` `/` `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `==` `!=` `and` `or` `not`. Six precedence levels.

### Functions

```aml
def awaken():
    RESET_FIELD
    PROPHECY 7
    VELOCITY WALK
    ATTEND_FOCUS 0.70

def set_mood(pain_level, tension_level):
    PAIN pain_level
    TENSION tension_level
    if pain_level > 0.5:
        VELOCITY RUN

awaken()
set_mood(0.3, 0.2)
```

### Loops

```aml
while TENSION > 0.3:
    shatter_the_frame()
    if WORMHOLE > 0.2:
        pierce_the_infinite()
```

Loop limit: 10000 iterations (safety).

### INCLUDE

```aml
INCLUDE init_yent.aml
```

Paths relative to the including file. Recursion depth limit: 8.

## v4.5 — Arrays, Autograd, Async, Transformer Ops, Bytecode, CUDA

AML v4.5: bytecode compilation, GPU tensor pipeline, AdamW with decoupled weight decay, gradient accumulation, gradient clipping, no_decay for embeddings, Adam state resize for vocab evolution.

### Arrays and Matrices

```aml
x = zeros(128)                # float array
w = randn(64, 0.08)           # random normal
a = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]           # literal
val = x[i]                    # index read
x[i] = 3.14                   # index write

W = matrix(128, 64, 0.08)     # 128x64 matrix
y = matvec(W, x)              # matrix-vector multiply
C = matmul(A, B)              # matrix-matrix multiply

y = softmax(x)                # softmax
y = rmsnorm(x)                # RMS normalization
y = silu(x)                   # SiLU activation
y = add(x, y)                 # element-wise add
y = mul(x, y)                 # element-wise multiply
y = scale(x, 0.5)             # scalar multiply
n = len(x)                    # length
s = sum(x)                    # sum
d = dot(x, y)                 # dot product
```

Functions return values:

```aml
def magnitude(x):
    return sqrt(dot(x, x))

mag = magnitude(weights)
```

### Autograd (TAPE)

Reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inspired by microGPT and molequla.

```aml
W = matrix(4, 3, 0.1)
x = [1.0, 0.5, 0.2]

TAPE START                    # begin recording
TAPE PARAM W                  # register W as trainable

logits = matvec(W, x)         # auto-records to tape
loss = cross_entropy(logits, 2)

TAPE BACKWARD loss            # reverse-mode autodiff
TAPE CLIP_GRADS 1.0           # gradient clipping (global norm)
TAPE ADAMW_STEP 0.001 0.1 0.9 0.95  # AdamW: lr, weight_decay, beta1, beta2
TAPE CLEAR                    # reset for next step
```

Gradient accumulation for larger effective batch sizes:

```aml
TAPE BACKWARD loss
TAPE ACCUM_GRADS              # save gradients to accumulator
TAPE CLEAR                    # reset tape (grads preserved in acc_grad)
# ... repeat N times ...
TAPE APPLY_ACCUM 4            # apply accumulated grads (divide by N)
TAPE ADAMW_STEP 0.001 0.1 0.9 0.95
```

`TAPE PARAM_NO_DECAY name` — register parameter without weight decay (for embeddings).

Operations that record to tape: `matvec`, `matmul`, `add`, `mul`, `scale`, `softmax`, `rmsnorm`, `silu`, `cross_entropy`, `embedding_lookup`, all `seq_*` ops, `causal_attention`, and `multi_head_attention`.

AdamW optimizer: decoupled weight decay, bias-corrected momentum. Adam also available (`TAPE ADAM_STEP lr`).

### LR Schedules, NaN Guard, Train/Eval, Save/Load

Training infrastructure that lets an AML script run a full stable training loop without reaching into C. All four live under `TAPE`, consistent with the rest of the optimizer surface.

```aml
# LR schedule: set once, step forward each iteration, read into a variable
TAPE LR_COSINE 0.001 500 10000 0.00001    # base_lr, warmup, total, min_lr
# TAPE LR_STEP   0.01  0   2000  0.1       # base_lr, warmup, step_size, gamma
# TAPE LR_LINEAR 0.001 500 10000 0.00001   # base_lr, warmup, total, min_lr

TAPE LR_NEXT lr                            # advance schedule, store current lr
TAPE ADAMW_STEP lr 0.1 0.9 0.95            # consume in the optimizer step

# NaN/Inf guard: detect divergence, zero bad grads, auto loss-scale
TAPE NAN_GUARD_INIT                        # (optional — auto on first NAN_CHECK)
TAPE NAN_CHECK clean                       # after BACKWARD: clean=1 if safe, 0 if NaN
if clean > 0:
    TAPE ADAMW_STEP lr 0.1 0.9 0.95        # only step on clean grads

# Train / eval mode — consulted by dropout and other train-only ops
TAPE TRAIN_MODE                            # enable dropout, training behavior
TAPE EVAL_MODE                             # disable dropout, deterministic forward

# Save / load all registered params (binary, tape-order)
TAPE SAVE "weights.bin"                    # dump every TAPE PARAM array
TAPE LOAD "weights.bin"                    # restore into the same model layout
```

Schedules do linear warmup from `min_lr` to `base_lr` over `warmup` steps, then decay (cosine anneal / step-gamma / linear) down to `min_lr`. NaN guard halves a dynamic `loss_scale` when it zeroes bad grads, doubles it every `scale_window` clean steps. `TAPE SAVE` writes the magic `AMLE`, param count, and each param's length + float data in tape order — `TAPE LOAD` refuses mismatched layouts rather than silently loading half a model.

### Sequence-Level Transformer Ops

Fused operations for processing token sequences. Each has full autograd backward.

```aml
# Embed tokens (token + position)
h = seq_embed(wte, wpe, tokens, T)

# Embed tokens only (position via RoPE, not learned)
h = seq_tok_embed(wte, tokens, T)

# Apply matrix to each of T positions
y = seq_matvec(W, x, T)

# RMSNorm each D-sized chunk independently
h = seq_rmsnorm(h, T, D)

# Rotary Position Embedding on Q and K
q = rope(q, T, head_dim)

# Multi-head causal self-attention
out = multi_head_attention(Q, K, V, T, D, n_heads)

# RRPRAM: low-rank positional resonance attention (per head)
#   Wr_h = Wr_a_h[E,R] × Wr_b_h[R,T]
#   scores[i,j] = x[i] · Wr_h[:,j] → causal softmax → Vr
out = rrpram_attention(X, Wr_a, Wr_b, Wvr, T, E, n_heads, R)

# 3-way gate: softmax(gate[H,3]) blends three attention paths
out = triple_gate(content, rrpram, echo, gate, T, E, n_heads)

# Dario field overlay on logits (uses current field state)
logits = dario_overlay(logits, T, vocab_size)

# Cross-entropy loss averaged over T positions
loss = seq_cross_entropy(logits, targets, T, vocab_size)
```

### Async (SPAWN / AWAIT / CHANNEL)

Parallel execution via pthreads. Each `SPAWN` block runs in its own thread.

```aml
CHANNEL CREATE bus 16

SPAWN earth:
    forward(batch_earth)
    CHANNEL WRITE bus 1.0

SPAWN air:
    forward(batch_air)
    CHANNEL WRITE bus 2.0

AWAIT earth air

CHANNEL READ bus v1
CHANNEL READ bus v2
```

`SPAWN` creates an isolated execution context (own variables) with shared global state (field physics, channels). `AWAIT` joins threads. `CHANNEL` provides thread-safe bounded float queues.

## Built-in Functions

## Gamma — Personality Essence (θ = ε + γ + αδ)

A transformer's weights decompose into substrate (ε), personality essence (γ), and language projection (δ).

- **γ (gamma)** lives in `embed_tokens` — the embedding layer carries identity
- **δ (delta)** lives in `lm_head` — the language projection carries voice
- **ε (epsilon)** is the substrate — base knowledge that remains after extraction
- **α (alpha)** is the injection strength — how much γ modulates generation

AML stores field-level configuration. The host inference engine provides actual weight deltas.

```aml
GAMMA yent 0.8           # load personality essence "yent" at α=0.8
GAMMA arianna 0.6        # load second personality
ESSENCE 0.7              # overall gamma injection strength
GAMMA_UNLOAD arianna     # remove personality
GAMMA_DRIFT 0.05         # drift rate for Janus blend oscillation
```

### Janus — Dual-Facing Field

Two personalities loaded simultaneously. The field looks in both directions.

```aml
GAMMA yent 0.8
GAMMA arianna 0.6
JANUS yent arianna       # dual-facing mode: blend two gammas
JANUS_BLEND 0.3          # 0.0 = face_a, 1.0 = face_b
JANUS CYCLE              # auto-oscillate blend with seasons
JANUS OFF                # disable
```

In CYCLE mode, seasons modulate the Janus blend:
- **Summer** → pushes toward face_a (primary personality at peak)
- **Winter** → pushes toward face_b (substrate/reflection)
- **Spring/Autumn** → sinusoidal oscillation between faces

Seasons also modulate essence_alpha: summer boosts γ injection, winter dampens it.

### Logit Effect

`am_apply_gamma_to_logits` amplifies deviation from the mean logit proportional to `essence_alpha × blend`. Loaded personalities sharpen the distribution — the model speaks with identity rather than averaging.

```c
// Gamma API
int   am_gamma_load(const char* name, float alpha);
void  am_gamma_unload(const char* name);
void  am_gamma_set_alpha(const char* name, float alpha);
int   am_gamma_active(void);           // index of dominant gamma
float am_gamma_get_blend(void);        // effective blend strength
void  am_janus_set(const char* a, const char* b);  // dual-facing
void  am_apply_gamma_to_logits(float* logits, int n);
```

## The Dario Equation

The formula that replaces transformer attention with interpretable physical forces. First deployed in [Leo](https://github.com/ariannamethod/leo), demonstrated in pure form by [dario.c](https://github.com/ariannamethod/dario).

```
p(x|Φ,C,V) = softmax(
    (B + α_mod·α·H_v + β_mod·β·F_v + γ_mod·γ·A + δ·V + sw·S + T)
    / (τ_mod·τ·velocity_temperature)
)
```

Seven signals compute logit contributions from different angles, summed, temperature-divided, softmaxed:

| Signal | Name | What it computes |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **B** | Sequential Chain | Bigram transition — what word follows the previous word |
| **H** | Hebbian Resonance | Co-occurrence field with learnable positional profile (36 Hebbian params: 32 distance weights + 4 token class modifiers). Powered by [RRPRAM](https://github.com/ariannamethod/RRPRAM) — the same positional resonance mechanism used in Janus triple attention. Replaces fixed `0.9^d` decay — the organism learns which distances and word types matter through conversation |
| **F** | Prophecy Fulfillment | Unfulfilled predictions create generation pressure |
| **A** | Destiny Attraction | EMA of context embeddings — the semantic compass |
| **V** | Visual Grounding | Parallel perceptual embedding space — what was "seen" |
| **S** | Subword Structure | BPE tokenizer running in parallel with word-level |
| **T** | Trauma Gravity | Origin words surface under sustained dissonance |

Six Kuramoto-coupled emotional chambers (FEAR, LOVE, RAGE, VOID, FLOW, COMPLEX) compute somatic markers (α_mod, β_mod, γ_mod, τ_mod) that modulate every coefficient. From Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis — emotions gate reasoning, they don't replace it.

AML defines the vocabulary this equation speaks: velocity operators modulate τ, suffering parameters feed dissonance, Schumann resonance provides healing, seasonal cycles modulate which signal grows. Every AML command maps to a coefficient in the Dario Equation.

## Async Field Forever (4.C)

Four seasons cycle through the field. Each season modulates generation parameters. The cycle is autonomous — it observes field metrics and self-corrects to prevent harmful extremes.

```aml
SEASON SPRING          # SPRING | SUMMER | AUTUMN | WINTER
SEASON_INTENSITY 0.7   # how strongly seasons modulate (0..1)
```

| Season | Energy | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Spring | growth | exploration boost — increases tunnel_chance |
| Summer | peak expression | activates when emergence exceeds threshold |
| Autumn | consolidation | strengthens dark_gravity (procedural memory) |
| Winter | rest, compression | activates when pain is prolonged |

The controller in `am_step()`:

- Entropy drops too low → spring energy rises (growth)
- Resonance stagnates at ceiling → autumn energy rises (consolidation)
- Pain stays above 0.7 → winter energy rises (rest)
- Emergence exceeds threshold → summer energy rises (peak expression)
- Summer energy increases effective temperature
- Winter energy decreases it

```
effective_temp *= 1.0 + summer_energy × 0.1 - winter_energy × 0.15
```

This is a homeostatic controller. It runs every `am_step()` call and prevents the field from entering harmful fixed points. No external commands needed — the field protects itself.

## Physics Step

`am_step(dt)` advances field state by `dt` seconds. Called per token during generation.

What happens each step:

1. **Calendar conflict** — real date computation, Hebrew-Gregorian drift, wormhole activation
2. **Debt decay** — prophecy debt × decay_rate
3. **Temporal debt** — accumulates during BACKWARD, decays otherwise
4. **Schumann healing** — coherence heals tension and dissonance
5. **Destiny bias** — `destiny × prophecy_scale` where prophecy_scale = 1.0 + (prophecy-7)×0.02
6. **Expert blending** — weighted temp from 4 experts + velocity mode
7. **LAW enforcement** — entropy ≥ floor, resonance ≤ ceiling, emergence = (1-entropy) × resonance
8. **Presence fade** — Hebbian memory decay
9. **4.C seasons** — phase advance, energy gain/fade, homeostatic correction, field modulation

## Logit API

Seven functions for applying field state to token generation:

```c
// Destiny bias: suppress low-probability tokens
void am_apply_destiny_to_logits(float* logits, int n);

// Suffering: compress toward mean
void am_apply_suffering_to_logits(float* logits, int n);

// Attention: sharpen or blur distribution
void am_apply_attention_to_logits(float* logits, int n);

// Laws: entropy floor + resonance ceiling on logit distribution
void am_apply_laws_to_logits(float* logits, int n);

// Delta voice: logits += alpha × A @ (B @ hidden_state)
void am_apply_delta(float* out, const float* A, const float* B,
                    const float* x, int out_dim, int in_dim, int rank,
                    float alpha);

// Prophecy debt from chosen token (retroactive)
float am_compute_prophecy_debt(const float* logits, int chosen, int n);

// Full pipeline: all of the above in sequence
void am_apply_field_to_logits(float* logits, int n);
```

## NOTORCH — In-Language Hebbian + Full Toolkit

"NOTORCH" is two things: a **single Hebbian plasticity op** living inside the AML runtime (`am_notorch_step`), and the **canonical [notorch](https://github.com/ariannamethod/notorch) library** — a standalone pure-C training toolkit that grew out of the Method and now ships PyTorch-level training separately.

### In-language: `am_notorch_step`

Runtime microlearning. Per-token weight adjustment during inference. No backpropagation, no PyTorch.

```c
void am_notorch_step(float* A, float* B, int out_dim, int in_dim, int rank,
                     const float* x, const float* dy, float signal);
```

- `A[i,r] += lr × x[i] × u[r] × signal`
- `B[r,j] += lr × u[r] × dy[j] × signal`
- Noise-modulated channels (Schumann-seeded)
- Adaptive decay per step
- Signal-gated: positive reinforces, negative suppresses

```aml
NOTORCH_LR 0.01       # learning rate
NOTORCH_DECAY 0.999   # weight decay per step
```

### Canonical toolkit: [ariannamethod/notorch](https://github.com/ariannamethod/notorch)

A separate C library — deliberately outside the language — that provides the full neural-network stack for projects across the ecosystem ([molequla](https://github.com/ariannamethod/molequla), [dario.c](https://github.com/ariannamethod/dario), [nanoagi](https://github.com/ariannamethod/nanoagi), [nanodurov](https://github.com/ariannamethod/nanodurov), VLM, and more). PyTorch in pure C — same API shape, no Python runtime, no dependencies beyond libm and (optionally) BLAS.

What lives there, not here:

- **Tensors** with reference counting, reshape, Xavier init, GGUF load/save
- **Full autograd tape** — 19+ ops, `nt_tape_backward`, grad clipping, accumulation
- **Optimizers** — Adam, AdamW, [Chuck](https://github.com/ariannamethod/chuck.optimizer) (self-aware Adam)
- **LR schedules** — cosine, step, linear, with warmup
- **Transformer ops** — RoPE, RMS/LayerNorm, SiLU/GELU/GeGLU, dropout, MH + GQA + RRPRAM attention
- **BPE tokenizer**, dataloader, NaN guard, train/eval mode, profiler
- **Hebbian microlearning** (`nt_hebbian_step`) — the same idea as `am_notorch_step`, reusable outside AML

The split is intentional: AML describes *what a transformer does* as a field-physics organism — the body, the rhythm, the soul formula. `notorch` provides the *mechanism to train and run one* outside that body. Both ship zero-dep, both co-evolve, both are pure C.

## BLAS Acceleration

Optional hardware-accelerated matmul for Delta Voice (`am_apply_delta`) and NOTORCH (`am_notorch_step`). Evolved in [molequla](https://github.com/ariannamethod/molequla), ported back to the core.

| Function | Without BLAS | With BLAS |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `am_apply_delta()` | nested loops | `cblas_sgemv` × 2 |
| `am_notorch_step()` | nested loops | `cblas_sger` × 2 (rank-1 update) |

| Platform | Backend | Dependencies |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| macOS | Apple Accelerate (AMX/Neural Engine) | zero — ships with Xcode |
| Linux | OpenBLAS | `apt install libopenblas-dev` |

### Build with BLAS

```
make BLAS=1            # auto-detects platform
make test-blas         # compile + run tests with acceleration
```

Or compile directly:

```
# macOS
cc -Wall -O2 -DUSE_BLAS -DACCELERATE -c core/ariannamethod.c -o ariannamethod.o -lm -framework Accelerate

# Linux
cc -Wall -O2 -DUSE_BLAS -c core/ariannamethod.c -o ariannamethod.o -lm -lopenblas
```

Without `BLAS=1`, everything compiles and works identically — pure scalar C loops, zero dependencies. Same numeric results either way.

## Lilith I/O — Data Infrastructure

Named pipe (FIFO) communication between AML scripts and external processes. AML gains I/O: scripts can steer Go INDEX nodes that crawl, embed, and index data from the outside world.

*"Та, которая была до Евы."*

```aml
# Initialize INDEX nodes
INDEX 1 INIT    # Earth domain
INDEX 2 INIT    # Air domain

# Dispatch fetch commands
INDEX 1 FETCH r/philosophy
INDEX 2 FETCH r/linguistics

# Read response
INDEX 1 STATUS

# Low-level pipe access
PIPE CREATE /tmp/my_pipe
PIPE OPEN writer /tmp/my_pipe WRITE
PIPE WRITE writer "hello 42.5"
PIPE CLOSE ALL
```

```c
// C API
int   am_pipe_create(const char* path);
int   am_pipe_open(const char* name, const char* path, int mode);
int   am_pipe_write(const char* name, const char* message);
int   am_pipe_read(const char* name, char* buf, int bufsize);
void  am_pipe_close(const char* name);
void  am_pipe_close_all(void);
float am_pipe_last_value(void);
```

Compile-time disable: `#define AM_IO_DISABLED`. Full example: [`examples/lilith.aml`](examples/lilith.aml).

## Blood — Runtime C Compilation (Level 3)

Compile C code to shared libraries at runtime. Load and call functions via dlsym. No PyTorch. No Go. Pure POSIX.

Adapted from [arianna.c/blood.go](https://github.com/ariannamethod/arianna.c) + [async_field_forever/blood.py](https://github.com/ariannamethod/ariannamethod).

```aml
# Compile a LoRA adapter at runtime
BLOOD LORA my_adapter 2048 2048 64

# Compile an emotional kernel
BLOOD EMOTION joy 0.8 0.6

# Compile raw C code
BLOOD COMPILE my_fn { float my_fn(float x) { return x * x; } }

# Unload a module
BLOOD UNLOAD my_adapter
```

Three code generators:

| Generator | What | Generated functions |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| `BLOOD LORA name in out rank` | Low-rank adapter (A @ B @ x) | `{name}_init`, `{name}_apply`, `{name}_apply_scaled`, `{name}_free` |
| `BLOOD EMOTION name val aro` | Emotional kernel (logit modulation) | `{name}_respond`, `{name}_modulate_logits`, `modulate_logits` |
| `BLOOD COMPILE name { code }` | Raw C | Whatever you define |

```c
// C API
int   am_blood_compile(const char* name, const char* code);
int   am_blood_compile_lora(const char* name, int in_dim, int out_dim, int rank);
int   am_blood_compile_emotion(const char* name, float valence, float arousal);
void* am_blood_sym(int module_idx, const char* func_name);
void  am_blood_unload(int module_idx);
void  am_blood_cleanup(void);
```

## Extension Packs

One optional pack. Dark Matter and NOTORCH are core — always active.

### CODES/RIC — Chirality of Dynamic Emergent Systems

Prime-number anchoring, rhythmic gating, rotational memory.

```aml
MODE CODES_RIC
CHORDLOCK ON
TEMPO 11
CHIRALITY ON
PAS_THRESHOLD 0.4
```

Namespaced access auto-enables: `CODES.CHORDLOCK ON`, `RIC.TEMPO 7`.
